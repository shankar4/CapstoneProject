Yelp Reviews were analyzed to prove that businesses regress to the mean

Rpub site for the 5-slide presentation: http://rpubs.com/shankar/BusinessRegressToMean 

Note: The large (400 MByte) file of treview.rds could not be uploaded due to limiations imposed by Github.
However, all other .rds files needed later to actually run the code are included. The treview.rds is the 
subset of yelpreview file with three columns, of text, date, and business_id. This can be easiy derived
from the Yelpreview file.
